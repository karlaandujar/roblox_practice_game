# Machine Functionality Practice (Roblox Prototype)

A small Roblox project created to test and practice machine functionality before implementing them in my main **Satori Cafe**, a cafe simulator, game. This prototype focuses on scripting, interaction, and system reliability for different types of drink machines.

---

## üß† Purpose
This project was designed as a **testing environment** to:
- Experiment with **Lua scripting** for interactive drink machines
- Practice using **touch events**, object detection, and part manipulation
- Debug and refine how machines respond to different inputs (e.g., cups, ingredients, etc.)
- Test machine timing, animations, and interactions before adding them to the full game

---

## üß© Features
- **Functional drink machines** (milk, chocolate, strawberry, etc.)
- **Touch event logic** that detects when cups interact with machines  
- **Test environment** for scripting reliability and part placement

---

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies
- **Roblox Studio** for building and scripting
- **Lua** for machine logic and event handling
- **ServerScriptService** for backend machine scripts
- **Workspace** for machine parts and interactive objects

---

## üîç What I Learned
- How to organize scripts for different machine components
- How to use **Touch events**, **Parent/Child relationships**, and **object renaming** in Lua
- How to test functionality in isolation before merging into a larger project
- The importance of **debugging and modular development**
